## Required prior knowledge  
You need to have a basic understanding of artificial neural nets and know how to use git, python, and jupyter notebooks.  

## Setup  
1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Install a virtual environment and the required packages:

    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Tested with python 3.11.3)

## Usage

# OCR with CNN
Create an OCR tool to understand how convolutional neural nets work

## Required prior knowledge  
You need to have a basic understanding of artificial neural nets and know how to use git, python, and jupyter notebooks.  

## Setup  
1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Install a virtual environment and the required packages:

    ```BASH
    pyenv local 3.11.3
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 
First start a jupyter notebook:  
    ```BASH  
    jupyter notebook  
    ```  
    
Then load the OCR_with_CNN notebook and follow the instructions.
